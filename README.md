I'm a junior web developer / programmer.

`I was a learner in 2022 with the Johnson 6.30 team @ BeCode`

This was my first *try* with the markup language *Markdown*.

## Who am I ?

A human being, learning day & night, with dreams !

I also do :

- catering, ecobuilding, inline skating...
- zen balancing.

These are a few of my favourite things ...
